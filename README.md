# FacialRecognition
We are making a facial recognition app, similar to google photos facial recognition, for our school computer science mid year project.
##
# How to run:
- In terminal type `python src/app.py` and click on the local url it prints out to access the user interface
- If the image is unknown you should add 5 different, yet similar pictures of that person
- If the image is known, congrats you recognized someone
